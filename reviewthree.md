## Summary
The game Limbo is a dark puzzle game with obsure beautiful simple graphics. The game place in a black and white world and you control a a little boy that is in a weird sort of hell. The boy is not powerful and does not have abilities the game makes you have to figure out puzzle with your brain. 
  The mood of the game is dark and scary and keeps you on the edge. The only thing you can do is run and figure out some pretty difficult puzzles. What make the game challenging is the puzzles and also it has  a one hit kill game. The one hit kill part is super funny. For example you could fall in water and just drown, or if you fall on spikes you dont lose health you lose your life. What make it funny is how rag dollish brutal it is for a simple and complex game.
  The enemies are pretty scary because one of the biggest enemies is a couple of big spiders that will stab you and kill you in one hit.
  The sound track meets the game so well by letting the sound of the boy running or the spider or traps take you in to tense uncomftable moments. This is one the top puzzle games of all time. If you are looking for a orginal puzzle game with hair gripping tension then this your game.
  The art style of the game is also orginal they did not go above and beyond with graphic to try to sale this game the dark and white tone play very well to give you the suspense and scary you come to hate.

## Final Thoughts
I like this game there is not anything i would say bad about it. The game is orginal which is what is lacking these days. The game gives you a challenge and makes you use your brain muscle to figure out some complex puzzle. The game can be played by hardcore gamers and just your average game. The art style and the soundtrack can make the game into a survivor horror puzzle game instead of just puzzle. The game can stand with any of the orignal puzzles and for that i would suggest you play it.

### Rating
If i could rate this game it would be 5 Stars 5 being the best 

## Summary
  As soon as i played this game it was heaven. To think it is a simple as the other Marios wrong. What makes this game is the so many things from the art style which is still traditional Mario 2d, to the music which is iconic, to the new but same moves.
  Here we are again Being a plumber task with saving a princess from the evilness of King Koopa and his mininos. 
  What makes this game stand out now it that you have ability yes ability. In the other mario you could grow big a shoot fire balls.
   In Super mario 3 you can fly, you can skip levels, you have more mini games, and more things to attract your attention. The flying is so convinent espically for speed runner all you have to do is get a leaf start running and take off. The game introduce secret tricks like skipping a whole level. The game introduces different bosses at the end of the worlds. Now what i am saying my not be news to you but if you go back and play the first mario you will understand how the dynamic growth was when you play Super Mario 3.
   Super Mario 3 worlds or so unique by themselves from going to a water world, to a big world where everything is large, to a plant world and more. The game introduces so many new enemies and new dangers that add the element that not just your every day gamer can play but a hardcore game can find themselves wanting to beat it if not speed run it. 
   The sound track is what brings it all together i can close my eyes and play the song and know exactly what it is. From the action buttons to, the different worlds themes songs, to the seperation from win things are going good and when it is dangerous.he game itelf.

## Final Thoughts
Super Mario 3 will go down as one of the all time games. Everything that i said did not do justice for when you play the game. The game takes from the orginal and builds into a maasterpiece. By adding different abilites, eniemes, and the soundtrack it sure does it father proud. The replay value on this is high because you want to always pick up and feel that sensation of joy once again. Mario started, Suoer Mario 3 is taking off and not slowing down this game is iconic and will never be forgotten.

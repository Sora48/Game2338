## Summary
  This Game is about a mercanery that is task to kill a woman by a mysterious person. He find out the woman is going to scrafice her self to save the village from monsters.Instead of killing her when he meets her once he finds out about her mission he chooses to accompany her since it is aligned with his own agenda. The story goes once a girl meets a certain age she goes off on a pilgramage to make it to the place where she must scrafice her self to make sure the gods are satisfyied. 
  The Battle System  is turn based tradtion; meaning that the enemy will take a turn to or come up with a strategy to hit you then once they are done it is your turn to do the same. The combat is fairly is to get a hold of. The game has turtorial that will help you get the hang of it fast. One thing about the battle system is the grinding which mean you have to do the same thing over and over to become stronger and get better weapons and items. People that dont like to beat up the same or different enemies over and over may not like this a game. Personally i like those type of games but i do have to admit that the grind on this game is really slow unless you go up against a high enemy which is a no no 
    The Eneimes  are tough just like in any game, for example  if you try to go against a level 6 and  you are level 1 that may not work out . The experience that you get is very little which can be fustrated espically if you are trying to get stronger (like i said alot of grinding). The bossses are not overly complicated you just have to understand the pattern and make the right moves.
  The Sound Track is beautiful, but after a while it could make you not so energetic, because it sounds like mellow music you listen to on a raining day. The problem with this sound track is that even on the battle parts it still mellow and just a little up tempo. Overall same sound some what blended together. It matches the tone of the game which is simple and not super complex which is good.
  The Enviroment take place in  ice mountain areas. It is somewhat a open linear world meaning once you leave a town you can run around to the next location instead of just pushing a button to go straight to the next destination. The towns are cool but they have the same standard layout. In the towns you can always find a merchant, cook, weapon, inn, and save place. The bad thing is that in alot of RPGS you can find treasure chest that or common to find weapons or items etc. In am seetsuna i feel they probably could have made different town just a little more lively.


## Final Thoughts
  I Am Setsuna is game i would tell any tradtional rpg fan to play. The game  is a tradtional RPG if you love Final Fantasy series or grandia series than you may love this one. 
  The combat and chess game within the combat is cool and fun. The fighting could have been more over the top meaning making one of you characters have a special move that made you drop your jaw. For the game it was not needed but it would have spice it up just to make it that much better. 
  The world and the sound of the game is mellow and can be depressing. I mean the soundtrack is mostly played in a piano which is beautiful, but the way they use it can be sad or less energetic. Now  with  that type of music it kind of makes it hard to grind over and over. You may find yourself putting your on a soundtrack on in the background to make the time pass by when you are grinding. The games is a read base game meaning no voice over so be prepared to read. The people of the game is not to dynamic i think the whole game goal was to make the game simple and clean, which means no one characters just stands out This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.

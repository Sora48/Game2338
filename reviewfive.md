## Summary
Megaman X is by far my favorite in the entry before megaman legends. The game that has ruled for a while and still is , is Mario, but here comes a badass kid that has a power gun with a all blue armor suit to defeat his enemies. Not only is his gun powerful but during your adventure you get more powers ups to help level up your health.For example you get a dash attack not only to move through the level fast but to help you get to hard to reach places. Another level up is a helmet that helps you break through objects to help get you in those diffcult places. That is just some of the game features that it has. Another feature to this game is the puzzle inside the puzzle, what i mean by that is each boss on the game gives you a power , like water, ice , fire, wind etc. Well if you choose the right boss to go to you may have a huge advantage against another boss. For example when you beat the shock boss and then got to the ice boss you can take off double health from that boss on top of shocking him to make it easier to win. The games has that puzzle element to keep you guessing which boss you should fight next. On top of being a badass with a power gun and getting different moves from different bosses there is a challenge to the game. This game is not just your run of the meal adventure you must have some skill in trying to stay alive. Now it is not as hard as the previous titles but it will keep you on your toes trying to stay alive.

## Final Thoughts
Megaman X is one of the games that bring me directly to my childhood reliving the feeling that i had the power to shoot a powerful blast at the enemy and succeed. Being a harcore game it gives the challenge that makes you have to pay attention to your enemies and to the bosses. Each world and boss is unique in the sense that the level matches what the boss is. For example if you go to a ice world the boss will have ice power which is pretty cool. It has a fun factor because you never know which boss you should fight first to get the upper hand on your next boss. This franchise a stood the test of time but Megaman X gave a already powerful weapon a great boost in the kick ass department

## Summary
This game Stars Sonic the hedgehog a fast furry blue animal that is out to save his other furry friends from Dr. Robotnik. When he discovers that the evil scientist, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, has been kidnapping them and converting them into robotic Badniks as part of a plot to collect all six of the fabled Chaos Emerald. Now what is cool about sonic the hedgehog is that it does stand the test of time meaning you can pick up the game today and still have fun and give yourself a challenge. Everyone knows about Mario being nintendo mascott, well that is the same thing for Sega Sonic is their mascot. What makes the game great is the soundtrack the buttons sounds the movements. It all feels like it just goes together like there is no need to second guess what is going on. The difference between mario and sonic sonic is also bad ass but he has super speed. Sonic is a quick pace game now it can be diffcult with the different traps that they have which makes it unique. For example there is a water stage that lets you go in the water but if you stay under to long you will die the trick here is to find a pocket bubble to breath with to continue to move under ground. What makes Sonic also stand out it the boss battle from each stage is different mechanics the boss uses to kill you. Now you still have to smash Robotnik to kill him but you must what his move set like on the first level he moves side to side with a recking ball to kill you. On the second stage he drops lave on the ground and you have to time your jumps to hit him and not get burn at the same time. What is also unique is that what makes you stay alive unless you fallout of the game is coins, as long as you have coins you basically can stay alive forever.
 The soundtrack is badass the soundbuttons make the game feel like a gamble and also a fast pace let get going game. Each level gives the feel of tension and danger and also strength. 
 In sonic you also have items that help you out like a bubble that is like  shield that let you take a hit with out being damage 
 Another item is a star power that lets you be untouchable for a couple of seconds making you just a reckoning ball moving like lighting all depending on how fast you are moving.

## Final Thoughts
This game is the opposite version of mario but it is slick fast and rocks. The character Sonic stands on its own to compete with Mario. While the both have the same objective moving from point a to be Sonic definitely does it with style and finesse. From his killer speed to his lighting move Sonic has made his mark. Sega has made a name with sonic and the arch nemsis Dr robotnik. The game has cool puzzle and unique boss fights that set is self apart from just a side scroll platformer. The soundtrack brings everything together from when you get hit and hear that noise you hate of you losing coins, to the sound of getting a star and destroying the enemies. This game is fun and can be picked up anytime to have a great time, now its no slouch you will die if you do not pay attention. This game is a must for anybody that love games you would be disrespecting yourself not to give it a shot
